# Evomark-It !

Evomark-it is a parser for the Evomark language. It is a part of the [EvoMark Framework](https://github.com/EvoEvolver/evomark-framework). As the name implies, evomark-it is based on [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it).

## Motivation

We built Evomark for academic writing with a markdown-like language, so that we can overcome the drawbacks of both LaTeX and Markdown. Check [EvoEvolver](http://www.evoevolver.org) for more information.
